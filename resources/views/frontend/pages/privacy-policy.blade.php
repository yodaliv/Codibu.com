                            <li>1.1) Codibu offers a variety of services to customers (“you”) which range from hosting
                                and
                                website services (including shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting, WordPress hosting,

                            </li>
                            <li>1.3) We also have a website (the “Website”) where website visitors, prospective customers
                                and
                                potential job applicants can find out more about us and our Services.

                        <br>
                        This section explains our privacy practices in relation to the data we collect when we provide
                        Hosting and Cloud Services to you.
                        <br>
                        In this section, “client” refers to businesses to which we provide the Hosting and Cloud
                        Services.
                        <ul>
                            <li>2.1) <b>What information do we collect when we provide Hosting and Cloud Services</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> 2.1.1) When clients use our Hosting and Cloud Services, they provide us with third
                                        party data. We only collect this data in accordance with our client’s
                                        instructions. This means that our clients are in control of the data they upload
                                        to our platforms.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.1.2) We enter into agreements with our clients that set out our legal obligations in relation to that data, and explain that we may only use such data to provide the Services to our client (i.e. to provide Hosting Services, Cloud Services or the Domain Registration Services). In many legal jurisdictions, particularly those within the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Codibu is considered to be a “data processor” in relation to such client data. Each of our clients would be considered to be a “data controller”. As a controller, each Codibu client is responsible for complying with the requirements for controllers under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which requires notice, disclosure and specific legal bases for transferring data to Codibu and using the Hosting and Cloud Services. As a processor, Codibu has some - but not all - of those responsibilities.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.1.3) If you would like more information about the data collected by a particular Codibu client and, in turn, transferred to Codibu, please refer to that client’s privacy notice which would typically be located on their website.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.1.4) There are instances in which we act as a data controller. The rest of this Privacy Policy explains our data collection practices in those circumstances.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                2.2) <b>Information that you provide</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>2.2.1) The personal information we collect from you when we provide you with Services will depend on the type of service or support you require.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.2.2) Some personal information is collected directly from you when you:
                                        <br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                (a) create an account or purchase any of our Services (for example, billing information, contact information, credit card number and in certain circumstances, government identification);
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                (b) request assistance from our technical support team (for example, your phone number or email address);
                                            </li>
                                            <li>(c) log in to your account, such as your log-in credentials (for example, your username and password);</li>
                                            <li>
                                                (d) complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (for example, your email address); or
                                            </li>
                                            <li>(e) participate in surveys or contests or participate in activities we promote which might require information from you.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.2.3) We will also collect and process other data that might be less obvious to you. For example, account-related information is collected in association with your use of the Services (like the types of services you have used, your payment history, the amount of your payments, your domain name, information about when products renew or expire, customer service requests, information requests, etc.).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.2.4) Some of this data may be personal data. We may use this information to contact you from time to time about our products, promotions and other services that relate to your account. You can manage and choose the information you want to receive. Please see Section 11 for more information.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.2.5) Most of the personal information that we collect is necessary to keep all of our Services functional and accessible by you. If we’re asking for personal information beyond this scope, we’ll make sure to clearly let you know why we need it (and what the effects of not providing it may be).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2.3) <b>Information we collect automatically</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        2.3.1) When you use our Hosting Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. This may include information like your IP address, your device type, any unique device identification numbers, browser types, information about your broad geographic location (for example, country or city level location) and other technical information that may identify you.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.3.2) By way of example, data about usage of services is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files and cookie/device IDs. This information includes specific data about your interactions with the features, content and links (including those of third parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services as well as the information listed in the previous paragraph.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>
                                2.4) <b>Information we collect from third party sources</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        2.4.1) In our capacity as a data controller, we may collect information from third parties. This may include information from partners in order to maintain functionality of your Services (such as domain name registrations and third-party email suites). We may combine this data with information we already have so that we can properly update, analyze, and expand our Services. This information will only be used for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</li>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing, until deletion is possible.
